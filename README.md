For now, this is a loose collection of scripts I put together for a series of
papers on communication and common interest co-written with [Peter
Godfrey-Smith](http://petergodfreysmith.com/). At some point I'll try to turn
this into a proper library.

See [this Jupyter notebook](tutorial.ipynb) if you want to know how it
works, and perhaps use it for your own research.
